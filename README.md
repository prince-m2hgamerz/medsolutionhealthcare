## Feature Highlights

### Lead Capture System
Four contact forms (`ContactForm`, `DoctorOpinionForm`, `InsuranceCheckForm`, `CallbackForm`) all POST to `/api/leads`, which inserts into Supabase `leads` table and sends a styled HTML email notification to the admin via Resend.

### Debounced Live Search
The `SearchInput` component provides URL-based search with 300ms debounce, inline clear button, mint focus ring, and result count display — used on doctors, hospitals, treatments, and hotels listing pages.

### Admin Authentication
Supabase SSR auth with cookie-based sessions. `middleware.ts` protects all `/admin/*` routes. Login page at `/admin/login`. Admin-only operations enforced via RLS policies.

### AI-Generated Imagery
All 121 images in `public/images/` were generated via the NVIDIA flux.2-klein-4b API using PowerShell automation scripts. Categories: home page hero/support, all treatments, specialties, about page, tourism destinations (Delhi landmarks + route cities), doctor portraits (35 unique), hospital exteriors (17 unique), and page heroes.

### Animation System
Framer Motion powers scroll-reveal animations (`motion.div` with `initial`/`whileInView`), staggered children, hover card lifts (`-translate-y-1`), AnimatePresence testimonial carousel, and section entrance transitions across all home page sections.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Lint
npm run lint
```

### Database Setup

1. Create a Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Copy your project URL and anon key into `.env.local`
3. Open Supabase SQL Editor and paste `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` — run it
4. Paste `supabase/migrations/002_seed_delhi_data.sql` — run it
5. Configure Authentication → Settings → redirect URLs for your domain

### Image Generation

All images were generated using NVIDIA flux.2-klein-4b. To regenerate:

```bash
# Generate 59 original images
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/generate-images.ps1

# Generate Delhi hospitals + doctor portraits
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/generate-delhi-images.ps1

# Generate remaining doctor portraits + tourism
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/generate-missing-images.ps1
```

---

## Deployment (Vercel)

The project is fully configured for Vercel deployment with a `vercel.json` file. All environment variables from `.env.local` must be added to the Vercel project dashboard under Settings → Environment Variables.

```json
// vercel.json — all 7 env vars are referenced
```

**Steps:**
1. Push to GitHub/GitLab
2. Import repo in Vercel
3. Set framework to Next.js
4. Add all environment variables
5. Deploy — no build command changes needed

---

## Development Notes

- **Unsplash removed** — all images are now local `/images/*.webp`, no `remotePatterns` needed for Unsplash
- **Fonts** — Inter from Google Fonts (`next/font/google`); NeueHaasGrotesk Display defined in font-face fallback chain (not bundled due to licensing)
- **Type safety** — `Database` generic removed from Supabase client due to type inference issues with newer supabase-js v2; runtime queries work reliably
- **Unused vars** — ESLint configured with `argsIgnorePattern: "^_"` for underscore-prefixed params
- **SQL caution** — Run migration scripts in order: `001_initial_schema.sql` first, then `002_seed_delhi_data.sql`
